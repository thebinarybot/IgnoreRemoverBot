# IgnoreRemoverBot

IgnoreRemoverBot is a Python utility that removes the word "ignore:" from the lines in a YAML (.yml) file where the line contains both "ignore:" and "api". This utility is particularly useful when working with YAML files generated by tools like mitmproxy2swagger, where certain valid APIs are marked with "ignore:", but you want to remove that label.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository or download the `ignore_remover.py` file from the repository.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `ignore_remover.py` file is located.

4. Run the following command to execute the utility:

   ```
   python ignore_remover.py path/to/your/file.yml
   ```
   
   **Replace path/to/your/file.yml with the actual path to your YAML file.**

5. The utility will process the file, removing the "ignore:" label from the corresponding lines with "api" in the YAML file.

6. The modified content will be saved back to the same file.

7. After the utility finishes, it will display a success message indicating the removal of the "ignore:" label from the corresponding lines with "api" in the YAML file.


## Example

Consider the following YAML file (example.yml) before running IgnoreRemoverBot:

  ```
  # example.yml
  - ignore:/workshop/api/
  - api: /users
  - ignore::8025/api/v2
  - ignore:/workshop/api/
  ```

Running IgnoreRemoverBot using the following command: ``` python ignore_remover.py example.yml ```

Will update the example.yml file to:

  ```
  # example.yml
  - /workshop/api/
  - api: /users
  - ignore::8025/api/v2
  - /workshop/api/
  ```

The word "ignore:" is removed from the corresponding lines where "api" is present.
